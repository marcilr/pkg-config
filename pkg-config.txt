pkg-config is a computer program that provides a unified
interface for querying installed libraries for the purpose
of compiling software from its source code.  It allows
programmers and installation scripts to work without
explicit knowledge of detailed library path information.
pkg-config was originally designed for Linux, but it is
now also available for the various BSDs, Microsoft
Windows, Mac OS X, and Solaris.

It outputs various information about installed libraries.
This information may include:

o Parameters for C or C++ compiler
o Parameters for linker
o Version of the package in question

The first implementation was written in shell.
Later, it was rewritten in C using the GLib library.

Synopsis
========
When a library is installed (automatically through the
use of an RPM, deb, or other binary packaging system
or by compiling from the source), a .pc file should be
included and placed into a directory with other .pc
files (the exact directory is dependent upon your
system and outlined in the pkg-config man page).  This
file has several entries.

These entries typically contain a list of dependent
libraries that programs using the package also need
to compile. Entries also typically include the location
of header files, version information and a description.

Here is an example .pc file for libpng:

    prefix=/usr/local
    exec_prefix=${prefix}
    libdir=${exec_prefix}/lib
    includedir=${exec_prefix}/include
 
    Name: libpng
    Description: Loads and saves PNG files
    Version: 1.2.8
    Libs: -L${libdir} -lpng12 -lz
    Cflags: -I${includedir}/libpng12

NOTE: pkgconf and pkg-config resolve to the same application
      on Debian jessie 8.9 amd64:

$ md5sum /usr/bin/pkgconf

$ md5sum /usr/bin/pkg-config
